Everyone loves them!\n\nIngredients\n2-3 packages @sweetlorens chocolate chip cookie dough\n2 cups chocolate chips (we used @enjoylifefoods )\n1 cup crushed gluten free graham crackers or @simplemills honey sweet thins\n1-2 cups marshmallow fluff\n\nPress half of your dough in a single layer in the bottom of a parchment line square baking pan. We used about 1 1/2 packs of @sweetlorenscookie dough for this. Use your fingers to press the dough into the pan.\n\nSprinkle the chocolate chips evenly on top and spread them out so the cookies are almost covered in chocolate.\n\nCrumble the graham crackers up and sprinkle them on top of the chocolate layer. The graham crackers have to be the middle layer because they won\u2019t stick to the cookie dough.\n\nScoop the marshmallow fluff on top and use a spatula to spread it out into an even layer. Spray the spatula with nonstick spray before spreading if you\u2019re having trouble with it sticking.\n\nPress the rest of the dough flat and lay them in rows on top of the marshmallow. It\u2019s ok if the marshmallow is showing through.\n\nBake them for 25-30 minutes, until the cookies are set and just golden brown. Keep a close eye on them the last 10 minutes to make sure the edges of the cookies and the marshmallow don\u2019t burn.\n\nLet them cool for at least an hour (ugh I know) then cut them into squares. You can speed up cooling by putting them in the fridge or freezer. #smorescookies #smoresbars #smores #summerdessert",

While I\u2019m an independent worker, I love to proactively give my managers updates before they feel the need to ask!\u201d\n\n\u2728 You want the interviewer to think \u201cWow! That\u2019s a really important strength to have in this role. And they said it so modestly!!\u201d\n\n\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffc Typically, you want to hit on a soft, interpersonal skill. Sure \u2014 you can say your greatest strength is photoshop, but it just ends up sounding flat.\n\nTry picking something that\u2019s appropriate for you industry. For example:\n\nVideo editor \u27a1\ufe0f collaboration\nEarly childhood educator \u27a1\ufe0f playfulness\nProject manager \u27a1\ufe0f organization\nClient lead \u27a1\ufe0f tine management\nNurse \u27a1\ufe0f compassion\nMarketing coordinator \u27a1\ufe0f communication\n911 operator \u27a1\ufe0f composure\n#career #careeradvice #careertiktok #careertok #resume #coverletter #college #internship #jobinterview",
